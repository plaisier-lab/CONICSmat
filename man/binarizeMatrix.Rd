\title{Binarize a matrix of posterior probabilities.}
\usage{
binarizeMatrix(mixmat, normal, tumor, threshold = 0.8, withna = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{mixmat}{Matrix of posterior probabilities between 0 and 1.}

\item{normal}{Vector of positions indicating the indices that identify posteriors assigned to normal cells.}

\item{tumor}{Vector of positions indicating the indices that identify posteriors assigned to tumor cells.}

\item{threshold}{Optional: Posterior threshold level. The presence of a CNV is assigned to a cell if its posterior exceeds the threshold.}

\item{withna}{Optional: Should posteriors that can't be assigned to component 1, but also not to component2, be set to 0 or NA (defualt is set to NA).}
}
\description{
This function allows to binarize a matrix of posterior probabilities. Input is a matrix containing the posterior probabilities for the component with the larger mean from a Gaussian Mixture Model across different regions.
